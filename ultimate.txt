All Requirements of Civil Service Management System (CSMS):
We need an application namely "Civil Service Management System (CSMS)" to manage HR processes for the Civil Service Commission- Zanzibar, overseeing employees across all government ministries. The system must include modules for Employee Profiles, Employment Confirmation, Leave Without Pay, Termination and Dismissal, Complaints, Promotions, Change of Cadre, Service Extensions, Retirement, Resignations, audit trail and Reports. 
Use a three-tier architecture namely, frontend – next.js 15, backend-spring boot 3 with maven and PostgreSQL 15 database.
1.	Tech stack:
Frontend: next.js 15
Backend: Spring Boot 3 with RESTful APIs.
Database: PostgreSQL 15
  UI & Styling:
  - Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
  - Radix UI components (various v1-2 versions)
  - Lucide React 0.475.0 (icons)
  - Class Variance Authority 0.7.1

Define user roles, data structures, forms, workflows, and notifications as specified below.
2. User Roles
Configure the following user roles with specific permissions:
The workflows for any module should adhere to the clarified user roles:
•	1. HR Officer (HRO): Submits requests on behalf of employees for all modules except Complaints. This user is from institution other than the Civil Service Commission (csc), here deferent institution HROs will send the HR requests to csc where request will be rejected, confirmed or forwarded back to HR for rectification. HRO is only allowed to see what is related to his institution only.
•	2. Head of HR Management (HHRMD): Approves or rejects requests for Confirmation, Promotion, LWOP, Change of Cadre, Retirement, Resignation, Approves or rejects Complaints, Termination, Dismissal requests and Service Extension; views reports and notifications. HHRMD is an internal user in csc and is allowed to view all data from different institutions.
•	3. Human Resource management officer (HRMO): Approves or rejects requests for Confirmation, Promotion, LWOP, Change of Cadre, Retirement, Resignation and Service Extension; views reports and notifications. HRMO is an internal user in csc and is allowed to view all data (Related to modules he approves only) from different institutions.
•	4. Disciplinary Officer (DO): Approves or rejects Complaints, Termination, and Dismissal requests; views reports and notifications. DO is an internal user in csc and is allowed to view all data (related to what he approves only) from different institutions.
•	5. Employee (EMP): Submits Complaints, which will be handled by HHRMD or DO whoever attends first. Read-only access his profile and complains he submit only. Not allowed to see other employee’s data. See only his data.
•	6. Planning Officer (PO): The Planning Officer is an internal user within the Civil Service Commission responsible for monitoring performance, workforce trends, and strategic HR data. Responsibilities and System Access: • View system-generated reports across all institutions. • Access dashboards and reports • Generate and analyze aggregated data to support strategic planning. • Export/download reports and visual analytics for presentation or external use. Access Level: • Read-only access to reports but not  dashboards across all CSMS modules. • No approval, submission, or modification privileges.
•	7. Civil Service Commission Secretary (cscs): is the highest authority in the Commission. In the CSMS system, this user should be able to: View all actions performed by the Head of HR Management (HHRMD), HR Management Officer (HRMO), and Disciplinary Officer (DO), including their current status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).
Access employee profiles across all public institutions.
Use a dashboard and a left-side navigation menu that displays the status of tasks being carried out by HHRMDs, HRMOs, and DOs in each module (e.g., Pending, Completed).
View and download institutional and system-wide reports from all modules.
•	8. Human Resource Responsible Personnel (HRRP) : is a supervisory HR figure within a specific institution (such as a Director of Administration or HR Manager). This user supervises HRO. In CSMS, this user can: View a dashboard summarizing HR activities in their respective institution. Access employee profiles within their institution only. View and download reports related to their institution only.
Track the status of requests submitted by their institution’s  HRO (e.g., Confirmation, Promotion, Leave Without Pay, etc.).
Monitor how the requests are being processed by HHRMD, HRMO, and DO.
9. admin: To oversee the technical and operational management of the system, including user accounts, access levels, module configurations, logs, and system health — ensuring that all users can perform their functions securely and efficiently.
•	 User Management, Create, update, and deactivate user accounts. Reset user passwords and be able to search users based on their names, ZanID or institutions.
•	Institution creation, add institution to the system eg. Wakala wa Vipimo Zanzibar , Wizara ya Elimu, wizara ya Afya, wizara ya Habari, wizara ya fedha etc.  each of these institution should be created by admin in his user interface after which admin will create the HRO for managing  hr request from those institutions.

4. Detailed workflow explanation with PlantUML and BPMN files 
structure for process modeling:
The workflows are designed to be intuitive (NFR6.001), secure (NFR2.002, AES-256 encryption), and scalable (NFR5.1, supporting 50,000+ employees). Sample data ensures consistency across modules.
2. Workflow 1: Employee Confirmation
Purpose: Automate confirmation after a 12-month probation period (FR8.01–FR8.03).
Actors:
•	HRO: Submits request (user_id: user3, username: ‘Khamis Mnyonge’).
•	HHRMD : Approves/rejects (user_id: user2, username: ‘Safia Khamis’).
•	HRMO : Approves/rejects (user_id: user4, username: ‘Fauzia Iddi’).
•	Employee: Subject (emp1, ‘Ali Juma Ali’, zan_id: ‘221458232’).
2.1 Steps
1.	Login: HRO logs in via Login Screen (Appendix B, UI-001).
o	API: POST /auth/login (Request: { "username": "Khamis Mnyonge", "password": "securepassword123" }, Response: { "status": "success", "data": { "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1Ni..." }, "message": "Login successful" }).
o	Audit Log: log8, user3, “Login”.
2.	Navigate: HRO selects “Confirmation” from Dashboard (Appendix B, UI-002, UI-004).
3.	Submit Request: HRO searches emp1, fills probation_end_date (2019-09-10), uploads confirmation_letter.pdf (≤2MB).
o	API: GET /employees?query=221458232, POST /confirmation (Request: { "employee_id": "emp1", "request_type": "Confirmation", "status": "Pending", "created_by": "user3", "details": { "probation_end_date": "2019-09-10" } }), POST /documents.
o	Audit Log: log9, req1, user3, “Create Request”.
4.	Review: HHRMD or HRMO logs in (whoever attends first), views req1 (API: GET /confirmation/req1).
5.	Approve or Reject: HHRMD or HRMO selects “Approve” or “Reject”, uploads decision_letter.pdf if approved, or rejection_reason (“Incomplete probation”) if rejected (API: PUT /confirmation/req1/approve or PUT /confirmation/req1/reject).
o	System: Updates req1 status to “Approved” or “Rejected”; if approved, updates emp1 status to “Confirmed”; notifies HRO (user3).
o	Audit Log: log10, req1, user2, “Approve/Reject Request” (before_value: { "status": "Pending" }, after_value: { "status": "Approved" or "Rejected" }).
6.	Error Handling: Invalid PDF (>2MB) or probation <12 months shows UI error (text-red-500: “Invalid input”).

12. Design Principles
•	Automation: Minimizes manual steps with automatic routing and notifications (FR4.03–FR12.03).
•	Security: JWT-based RBAC (NFR2.002), AES-256 encrypted documents (NFR3.002), immutable logs (FR14.01).
•	Usability: Clear UI feedback with error messages and success alerts (NFR6.001).
•	Scalability: Pagination and indexing for 50,000+ records (NFR5.1).
•	Traceability: Actions logged with before/after values (FR14.01).
13. Implementation Notes
•	Backend: Spring Boot 3 microservices (SDD Section 3.1) for APIs (Appendix B).
•	Frontend: node.js 15
•	Database: PostgreSQL 15 with SQL schema (e.g., employee, request, complaint).
•	External Integration: LWOP and Retirement integrate with HRIMS systems (FR5.04, FR10.04).
•	Testing: Validate during UAT (November 4, 2025, Inception Report Section 12).
9.	Sample Data Table
Use the data in this table to seed the database and creating sample data of the system.



15. Notes
•	Scope: Covers all SRS HR modules with clarified roles, explicit approval/rejection outcomes, and HRO notifications.
•	Sample Data: Uses emp1–emp6, user1–user7, req1–req10, comp3, log8–log37.
•	PlantUML: Diagrams include branching for “Approve” or “Reject” to reflect the new requirement. Render using PlantUML or IDE plugins (e.g., VS Code).
•	Visuals: Text-based flows and PlantUML code replace graphical diagrams. For enhanced visuals, render PlantUML output in Lucidchart or draw.io.
•	Termination only for employee in probation while Dismissal is for confirmed employee.
